# 🎯 **Car Price Prediction Model**  
Predict the price of a car based on its features using machine learning.

---

## 📝 **Problem Statement**  
Estimating the price of a car based on its features is critical for buyers and sellers to make informed decisions. This project aims to predict the price of a car using a **Linear Regression Model**, ensuring accuracy and interpretability.

## 📂 **Dataset**  
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Car Price Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/) (or any available dataset if unspecified)  
- **Description**:  
  - **Features**:  
    - `Make`: Brand or manufacturer of the car.  
    - `Model`: Specific model of the car.  
    - `Year`: Year of manufacture.  
    - `Mileage`: Distance traveled by the car (in kilometers/miles).  
    - `Fuel Type`: Type of fuel used (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, Electric).  
    - `Transmission`: Gear system (Manual/Automatic).  
    - `Engine Size`: Engine capacity in liters or cubic centimeters.  
  - **Target**: `Price` (in USD or other currency).

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `pandas` - Data manipulation  
  - `numpy` - Numerical computations  
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` - Data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` - Machine learning implementation

## 🔍 **Project Workflow**  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Load the dataset and inspect its structure.  
   - Handle missing values and outliers.  
   - Convert categorical features into numerical using techniques like one-hot encoding.  
   - Normalize or standardize numerical features for consistent scaling.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Analyze the distribution of car prices.  
   - Visualize correlations between features and price using heatmaps and scatter plots.  

3. **Model Building**:  
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.  
   - Train a **Linear Regression Model** on the training data.  
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like **R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.  

4. **Prediction**:  
   - Test the model with unseen data.  
   - Predict car prices based on given features.
