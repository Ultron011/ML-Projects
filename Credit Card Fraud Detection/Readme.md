# 💳 **Credit Card Fraud Detection Model**  
Detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning.  

---

## 📝 **Problem Statement**  
Credit card fraud causes billions of dollars in losses annually, creating a pressing need for automated detection systems. This project implements a **Logistic Regression Model** to classify transactions as **fraudulent** or **legitimate**, achieving a high level of accuracy.

## 📂 **Dataset**  
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  
- **Description**:  
  - **Features**:  
    - `V1, V2, ..., V28`: Principal components obtained using PCA for privacy reasons.  
    - `Time`: Seconds elapsed since the first transaction in the dataset.  
    - `Amount`: Transaction amount.  
  - **Target**: `Class`  
    - `1`: Fraudulent Transaction  
    - `0`: Legitimate Transaction

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `pandas` - Data manipulation  
  - `numpy` - Numerical computations  
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` - Data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` - Machine learning implementation

## 🔍 **Project Workflow**  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Load the dataset and inspect its structure.  
   - Handle missing values (if any) by imputing or dropping them.  
   - Normalize the `Amount` feature for improved model performance.  
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Analyze the distribution of fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions.  
   - Visualize correlations between features using heatmaps.  
   - Explore feature importance using statistical methods.  

3. **Model Building**:  
   - Train a **Logistic Regression Model** on the training data.  
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.  

4. **Prediction**:  
   - Test the model with unseen data.  
   - Predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.

## 📊 **Results**  
- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression  
- **Accuracy**: High performance with robust detection of fraudulent transactions.
