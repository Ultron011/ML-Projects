# üéØ **Heart Disease Prediction Model**  
Predict the likelihood of heart disease based on clinical and demographic data using machine learning.

---

## üìù **Problem Statement**  
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment and prevention. This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease using a **Logistic Regression Model**, providing a simple yet effective tool for medical decision-making.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `pandas` - Data manipulation  
  - `numpy` - Numerical computations  
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` - Data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` - Machine learning implementation

## üîç **Project Workflow**  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Load and inspect the dataset.  
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data.  
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., `Chest Pain Type`, `Exercise Angina`).  
   - Normalize numerical features for better model performance.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Analyze correlations between features and target variable.  
   - Visualize data using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.  

3. **Model Building**:  
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.  
   - Train a **Logistic Regression Model** on the training data.  
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.  

4. **Prediction**:  
   - Test the model on unseen data.  
   - Predict the likelihood of heart disease for new patients.
