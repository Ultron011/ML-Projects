# 🎯 **Rock vs Mine Prediction**  
Classify sonar signals as either **rock** or **mine** using machine learning.

---

## 📝 **Problem Statement**
Detecting mines in a marine environment is essential for safety and navigation. This project aims to classify objects detected via sonar signals as either **rocks** or **mines** using advanced machine learning techniques.

## 📂 **Dataset**
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Sonar Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connectionist+Bench+%28Sonar%2C+Mines+vs.+Rocks%29)  
- **Description**:
  - **207 samples**: Each representing sonar signals.
  - **61 features**: Representing energy levels at different frequencies.
  - **Labels**:  
    - `R`: Rock  
    - `M`: Mine

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` - Data manipulation
  - `numpy` - Numerical computations
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` - Data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` - Machine learning implementation

## 🔍 **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
   - Normalize the features for consistent scaling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze data distributions and relationships.
   - Visualize data using plots like histograms and pairplots.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Test the model with unseen data.
   - Predict whether a sonar signal represents a rock or a mine.

## 📊 **Results**
- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression  
- **Accuracy**: 76% on test data
