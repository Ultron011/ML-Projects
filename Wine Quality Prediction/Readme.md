## üîç **Project Workflow**  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Load the dataset and inspect its structure.  
   - Handle missing values and outliers.  
   - Normalize numerical features to improve model performance.  
   - Categorize `Quality` into discrete classes for classification.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Analyze distributions of physicochemical properties.  
   - Visualize relationships between features and wine quality using correlation heatmaps and pair plots.  

3. **Model Building**:  
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.  
   - Train a **Random Forest Classifier**.  
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.  

4. **Prediction**:  
   - Test the model with unseen data.  
   - Predict the quality category of wine samples.
